# Smart-LPG-gas-Level-Detection
<H1>Project Desciption</H1>
<H4>This Project Consists of the GSM-based alert system through SMS of a new LPG cylinder . Usually, the capacity of LPG in the Cylinder is not determined, so we are going to display the level of LPG. 

The objective of this work is to monitor the gas cylinder continuously and display the weight of gas present inside the cylinder and send an alert to the user when the gas weight comes below the threshold level of 2kgs it sends a message to the user

Usually the capacity of LPG in Cylinder is not determined, so we are going to display the level of LPG. The level of LPG is measured using INVENTO Load Cell+HX711 Weight weighing A/d Module Pressure Sensor. The output of the sensor is connected with Arduino Uno.

By use of  SIM800L GSM/GPRS Module, the information is sent to user by SMS (short messaging service) so that user can apply for refill or booking.</H4>
